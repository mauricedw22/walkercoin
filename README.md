# Walkercoin, a custom token built on Stellar!
<div align="center">
<h1>Test token wallet app by Maurice W2</h1>
<strong>Walkercoin (ticker:WALK) is a token used to quantify bragging rights and award users (currently just people within the Walker family) with something for winning family card games, 
Monopoly board game challenges, family dance-offs and much more! </strong><br><br>
  <strong> Try the <a href="https://walkercoin.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Walkercoin wallet app</a> live!</strong>

This token and wallet app were built purely for entertainment purposes and should not be considered legal tender of any kind.  

It is written in Node.js and runs on Linux, OSX and Windows with MongoDB running in background for local development.

# Notes

This Node.js application currently permits XLM to be stored and WALK to be sent to and from addresses generated within the wallet. Secret keys will be made available to token holders once
obsfuscation feature is added for security purposes. <br><br>
